  <table>
    <tr><td>Management fees</td><td>0.15%</td></tr>

    <li>"Other expenses" are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year.</li>
    <li>The investment manager has contractually agreed to waive or assume certain fees and expenses so that total annual Fund operating expenses (excluding Rule 12b-1 fees, acquired fund fees and expenses and certain non-routine expenses or costs, including those relating to litigation, indemnification, reorganization and liquidation) for the Fund do not exceed 0.20% until July 31, 2022. During the term, this fee waiver and expense reimbursement agreement may not be terminated or amended without approval of the board of trustees except to add series and classes, to reflect the extension of termination dates or to lower the cap on the Fund's fees and expenses (which would result in lower fees for shareholders).</li>

  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of the period. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects adjustments made to the Fund's operating expenses due to the fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by management for the 1 Year numbers only. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:</p>
